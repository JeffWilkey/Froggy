# Froggy

## Description

Frogger Clone Experiment, built this over a few days while trying to teach myself C# and Unity, still a lot of little bugs in there and I don't really plan to fix them but I'm taking away a lot more knowledge than I came in with. Credit for music goes to [Tallbeard](https://tallbeard.itch.io/music-loop-bundle) and sounds come from [Classic Gaming](http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/frogger/sounds) . Also got some help looking at this repo as an example [Unity Frogger Tutorial by Zigurous](https://github.com/zigurous/unity-frogger-tutoria) - I think there's a youtube tutorial associated w/ that repo too. Make sure to check those guys out and thank you for checking out this little project.
